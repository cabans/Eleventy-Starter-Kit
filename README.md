# Cabans Eleventy Starter Kit

A simple [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) (11ty) Starter Kit, that it works as base for all my static projects. 

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is a work in progress, you have been warned üòä


## Key Features

* CSS working with Sass (SCSS syntax)
* CSS clean and minification on production
* JS Bundling via 11ty.js script (Webpack)
* Image optimization
* Uses Nunjucks as template engine
* HTML ninification
* Everything runs through Eleventy
* i18n support by default

## Getting Started

To install the necessary packages, run the command on your package manager flavor of choice:

```sh
npm install
yarn
```

### Commands

* Run `npm start` for a development server and live reloading
* Run `npm run build` to generate a production build (output in `dist` folder)

## CSS

Styles works with Sass (SCSS syntax). The main file is in `src/assets/styles/main.scss`.
On `build` command it will be processed and optimized. The output is in `dist/assets/styles/main.css`

## JS

Javascript works with ES6 syntax, trough WEbpack. The main file is in `src/assets/scripts/main.js`.
It will be transpiled and minified in production. The output is in `dist/assets/scripts/main.js`
